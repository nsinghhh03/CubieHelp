# === Column Hints ===
# ShipmentDate – date shipment left origin
# ActualDeliveryDateTime – timestamp when shipment was delivered to recipient
# DeliveryDays – you can compute it via DATEDIFF(day, ShipmentDate, ActualDeliveryDateTime)
# TTCarrierCode – carrier identifier (e.g., UPS, Purolator)
# CountryFrom / ShipperCountry – origin country; CountryTo / RecipientCountry – destination country
# All country values use ISO 2-letter codes e.g. CA for Canada, US for United States, GB for United Kingdom.
#
# Average delivery time guideline:
# • Use: AVG(DATEDIFF(day, ShipmentDate, ActualDeliveryDateTime))
# • Always include: WHERE ActualDeliveryDateTime IS NOT NULL to exclude in-transit records.

# === Query Examples (use these patterns when answering) ===
# 1. Shipments created in a given month
#    SELECT COUNT(*) AS shipments
#    FROM Shipment
#    WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate) = 2024 AND MONTH(ShipmentDate) = 5;
#
# 2. Average delivery time (days) for May 2024
#    SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(day, ShipmentDate, ActualDeliveryDateTime)) AS avg_delivery_days
#    FROM Shipment
#    WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate)=2024 AND MONTH(ShipmentDate)=5;
#
# 3. Percentage of shipments handled by a carrier in a year
#    /* numerator */
#    SELECT COUNT(*) AS carrier_shipments
#    FROM Shipment
#    WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate)=2024 AND TTCarrierCode='Purolator';
#    /* denominator */
#    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_shipments
#    FROM Shipment
#    WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate)=2024;
#    -- percentage_tool can be used with those two queries.
#
# 4. Late-delivery rate (>3 days) per carrier for June 2024
#    SELECT TTCarrierCode, 100.0*SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(day, ShipmentDate, ActualDeliveryDateTime)>3 THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) AS late_pct
#    FROM Shipment
#    WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate)=2024 AND MONTH(ShipmentDate)=6
#    GROUP BY TTCarrierCode;

# CarrierCodeAlias
# • The column is **TCCarrierCode** (note the extra “C”).
# • If you see TTCarrierCode or CarrierCode in a question, map it to TCCarrierCode.

# Example: average delivery time for Purolator in May 2024
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(day, ShipmentDate, ActualDeliveryDateTime)) AS avg_days
FROM Shipment
WHERE
    YEAR(ShipmentDate)=2024
    AND MONTH(ShipmentDate)=5
    AND TCCarrierCode='Purolator';


# === Hard-coded Query Examples ===
# Q: How many shipments were created this month?
# SQL:
# SELECT COUNT(*) AS shipments_this_month
# FROM Shipment
# WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate)=YEAR(GETDATE())
#   AND MONTH(ShipmentDate)=MONTH(GETDATE());
#
# Q: What is the average delivery time for shipments in June?
# SQL:
# SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(day, ShipmentDate, ActualDeliveryDateTime)) AS avg_delivery_days
# FROM Shipment
# WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate)=YEAR(GETDATE())
#   AND MONTH(ShipmentDate)=6
#   AND ActualDeliveryDateTime IS NOT NULL;
#
# Q: Show me the top 5 carriers by shipment volume.
# SQL:
# SELECT TOP 5 TCCarrierCode, COUNT(*) AS shipment_count
# FROM Shipment
# WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate)=YEAR(GETDATE())
# GROUP BY TCCarrierCode
# ORDER BY shipment_count DESC;
#
# Q: What percentage of this year’s shipments were international?
# -- Use percentage_tool with:
# numerator_sql:
#   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Shipment
#   WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate)=YEAR(GETDATE())
#     AND ShipperCountry <> RecipientCountry;
# denominator_sql:
#   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Shipment
#   WHERE YEAR(ShipmentDate)=YEAR(GETDATE());
#
# Q: What is the late-delivery rate per carrier for the last 3 months?
# SQL:
# SELECT TCCarrierCode,
#        100.0*SUM(CASE WHEN DATEDIFF(day, ShipmentDate, ActualDeliveryDateTime)>3 THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) AS late_pct
# FROM Shipment
# WHERE ShipmentDate >= DATEADD(month,-3,GETDATE())
#   AND ActualDeliveryDateTime IS NOT NULL
# GROUP BY TCCarrierCode;
