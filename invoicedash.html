            <h3>Shipment Charges Breakdown (Click on Shipment Charge Amount)</h3>
            <p>Users can click on the Total Shipment Charges amount for a breakdown of all applicable charges and taxes. This Shipment Charges and Taxes window categorizes each charge associated with the shipment, detailing:</p>

</section>

<section id="invoice-upload">
    <h2>Uploading Invoice Files</h2>
    
    <p>Audit Cube allows for seamless invoice processing through both automated and manual methods. The Invoice Upload feature enables users to manually upload invoice files in the required format for processing.</p>

    <h3>Automated Invoice Processing</h3>
    <p>Invoices are typically fetched automatically from carrier systems via SFTP integration. The system processes invoices in CSV format, retrieving them from the designated folder for each carrier. Once fetched, the invoices are automatically processed and made available in the Invoice Dashboard.</p>

    <h3>Manual Invoice Upload</h3>
    <p>For carriers that do not support automatic processing or when users need to manually upload invoices, Audit Cube provides an easy-to-use upload function.</p>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Every carrier has a unique invoice file format. The system is designed to recognize only the pre-approved formats for each carrier. Ensure the correct format is used to prevent upload errors.</p>

    <h3>Steps to Upload an Invoice File</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Click the <strong>Upload</strong> button on the Invoice Dashboard.</li>
        <li>A popup screen will appear, allowing users to select the invoice file from their desktop.</li>
        <li>Drag and drop the file into the designated area or manually browse for the file.</li>
        <li>Select the appropriate <strong>Carrier</strong> and <strong>Carrier Account</strong> from the dropdown menu.</li>
        <li>Once selected, the file name will be displayed in the upload dialog.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> to process the invoice file.</li>
        <li>After processing, the system will display a success or failure message, indicating whether the upload was successful.</li>
    </ol>

    <img src="img/invoiceuploadneww.png" alt="Invoice Upload View">

    <h3>Viewing Processed Invoices</h3>
    <p>After a successful upload, invoices appear in the Invoice Dashboard. This dashboard provides detailed insights into each uploaded invoice, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Invoice document details, such as carrier and account information.</li>
        <li>Navigation to related tracking numbers and shipment data.</li>
        <li>Options for managing disputes and reviewing audit details.</li>
        <li>Automated audit processing, ensuring immediate visibility and validation of invoice data.</li>
    </ul>

<section id="filtering-sorting">
    <h2>Filtering and Sorting Invoices</h2>
    <p>The filter icon, located next to the Upload button, allows users to sort and filter invoices based on specific variables such as Invoice Number, Audit Status, Dispute Status, and Dispute Category.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Use Filters:</strong> For example, by selecting the Audit Status filter, users can view all invoices by their approval status, allowing them to prioritize and address outstanding issues.</p>

<section id="audit-details">
    <h2>Audit Details</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Audit Details</strong> section within the Invoice Dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of invoice discrepancies by comparing expected charges with actual invoice amounts.</p>
    
    <p>To review an audited invoice:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the <strong>Invoice Dashboard</strong>.</li>
        <li>Locate the desired invoice entry and click on the <strong>Audit Detail</strong> button.</li>

            <li><strong>Carrier Code:</strong> Identifies the service provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Code:</strong> Specifies the type of service rendered.</li>

</section>

<section id="audit-trail">
    <h2>Audit Trail</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Audit Trail</strong> feature in the Invoice Dashboard enables users to track the history of audit comments, updates, and assignments related to a dispute line. This functionality ensures transparency and accountability by maintaining a log of all modifications and discussions associated with an invoice item.</p>

    <p>To update the audit comments for a dispute line:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the <strong>Invoice Dashboard</strong>.</li>
        <li>Locate the relevant invoice and click on the <strong>Audit Detail</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Enter the necessary comments regarding the dispute in the designated field.</li>
        <li>Assign the dispute to the appropriate processor for review and resolution.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Save</strong> to store the audit comments.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once saved, the comments are recorded in the audit trail of the invoice item. These notes serve as a detailed log of all interactions, providing a comprehensive historical record of discussions, reviews, and updates for the associated line item.</p>

<section id="troubleshooting">
    <h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2>

    <h3>Invoice Upload Issues:</h3>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> If an invoice file fails to upload, it is likely due to an incorrect file format or improperly formatted data within the CSV.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Verify File Format:</strong> Double-check that the file is saved in CSV format. Excel or other file formats will not be accepted by the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Check Data Formatting:</strong> Ensure that all required fields in the CSV are populated correctly and that the data adheres to the expected format (e.g., date formats, numerical values).</li>
        <li><strong>Re-upload:</strong> After correcting any issues, try uploading the file again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filter Not Applying Correctly:</h3>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Filters might not return the expected results, especially if there are conflicting filters applied or if the data does not match the selected criteria.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Clear All Filters:</strong> Start by clearing all filters and reapplying them one by one to identify any conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Expand Criteria:</strong> If the filter is too narrow, try expanding the criteria (e.g., selecting a broader date range or including multiple statuses) to capture the relevant data.</li>
        <li><strong>Refresh the Dashboard:</strong> If the filter results still seem incorrect, try refreshing the dashboard to ensure that all data is up to date.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Dispute Workflow Issues:</h3>
    <p><strong>Issue:</strong> Disputed invoices may not be moving through the workflow as expected, or users might not be able to track the dispute status accurately.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check Workflow Settings:</strong> Verify that the dispute workflow settings are correctly configured in the system. This includes ensuring that all necessary statuses are active and that communication logs are being updated.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Support:</strong> If workflow issues persist, contact technical support to review the system settings and ensure that the workflow is functioning as intended.</li>
