            <p>The Draft Rates section supports both Partial and Full Amendments to ensure flexibility and precision in rate finalization:</p>
            <h3>Partial Amendments:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Shippers can accept only a subset of updated lanes. For example, if 10 lanes are submitted by the carrier, the shipper may accept 5 lanes, rejecting or revising the rest.</li>
                <li>Revised lanes are sent back to the carrier for approval or rejection.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Full Amendments:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All updated lanes are accepted simultaneously, finalizing the entire contract.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Shipper and Carrier Responsibilities:</h2>
            <h3>Shipper Actions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Shippers can Reject, Accept, or Revise rates based on their requirements. Revising a rate generates a Partial Amendment for further carrier review.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Carrier Actions:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Carriers can only Accept or Reject counter-offers or amendment requests sent by the shipper.</li>

            <h3>Rate Simulation</h3>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                The Rate Simulation feature within Rate Maintenance allows users to simulate and compare rates under two scenarios:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Draft Rates:</strong> Users can select specific lanes to compare the current rates with changed rates.</li>
                <li><strong>Active Rates:</strong> Users can revise rates and simulate the difference between new and active rates. If the user approves the simulation results, an Offer for Amendment (OFA) is generated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This feature provides a comprehensive view of shipment costs under different scenarios, enabling better decision-making.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Step 1: Simulating Rates for Draft Templates</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong> Users can access the Rate Simulation module by selecting a draft template. Within the draft template, specific lanes can be selected to view and compare their current rates with updated or changed rates.
                The user is prompted to select a <strong>Shipment Profile</strong>—Low, Medium, or High. Each profile reflects the number of shipments per month (e.g., Low: 10, Medium: 100, High: 500), ensuring rate calculations reflect annual shipment charges.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 2: Comparing Rates for Draft Templates</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong> Once lanes and shipment profiles are selected, the system displays a comparison of rates. The comparison includes detailed breakdowns of draft and active charges side-by-side, showcasing the differences.
                Rate details such as base rates, fuel surcharges, handling fees, and other applicable charges are shown for both the draft and the updated rates.
            </p>
            <img src="img/sim2.png" alt="Comparing Rates for Draft Templates">
        
            <h4>Step 3: Revising Rates for Active Templates</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong> Users can simulate changes to active rates by revising parameters such as base rate, fuel surcharge, and handling charges. Like draft simulations, users can choose shipment profiles to reflect monthly shipment volumes and calculate annual charges.
                Revised rates are then compared to active rates within the system, allowing users to understand the impact of the changes.
            </p>

            <h4>Step 4: Simulating and Comparing Active Rates</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong> After revising rates, the system generates a comparison of the simulated rates with active rates. A detailed breakdown of charges is displayed, enabling the user to analyze cost variations between the revised and active rates.
            </p>
            <img src="img/sim4.png" alt="Simulating and Comparing Active Rates">
        
            <h4>Step 5: Accepting the Simulation and Creating an OFA</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Description:</strong> Once satisfied with the simulation results, users can accept the revised rates. Upon acceptance, the system automatically generates an Offer for Amendment (OFA), reflecting the updated rates.

            <h2>OFA and RFA Processes in Rate Maintenance</h2>
            <p>The OFA and RFA processes play a critical role in managing rate amendments between carriers and shippers. Below is a detailed guide to these processes, including actions, notifications, and key indicators.</p>
            <img src="img/ofa.png" alt="OFA Process Diagram">
    
            <h3>Offer for Amendment (OFA)</h3>
            <h4>Process Overview:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Initiation:</strong> A carrier uploads an OFA, and a unique reference number is generated for tracking.</li>
                <li><strong>Shipper Notification:</strong> A task is created, and an email notification is sent to the shipper.</li>
                <li><strong>Shipper Actions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Approval:</strong> The shipper can approve the OFA, creating a Full Amendment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Counteroffer:</strong> The shipper can counter the OFA, requesting revised rates.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Final Steps:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The carrier can accept the counteroffer or upload revised rates based on the shipper's request.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Key Indicators for Actions:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Actions taken by shippers are marked with an <strong>S</strong> indicator, while carrier actions are denoted by a <strong>C</strong>.</li>
                <li>Different colors represent various statuses:
                    <ul>

            <section id="ofa-rfa-processes">
                <h3>Steps to Create and Process OFA</h3>
                    <h4>Scenario 1: Full Counter OFA Acceptance Process</h4>
                    <p>This process involves:</p>
                    
                    <h5>Step 1: Initiate the OFA Process</h5>
                    <p>The process begins when the carrier initiates the OFA by selecting the relevant contract ID. This step ensures the correct contract is identified for amendments. Once selected, the carrier prepares to identify specific rates for amendment.</p>
                    <img src="img/fullofa1.png" alt="Initiate OFA Process">
                    
                    <h5>Step 2: Select and Export Rates for Amendment</h5>
                    <p>The carrier filters and selects the specific rates that require amendments. This can be done based on criteria such as contract validity, service levels, or origin/destination cities. After selecting the applicable rates, the carrier exports the data to make modifications offline.</p>
                    <img src="img/fullofa2.png" alt="Select and Export Rates">
                    
                    <h5>Step 3: Update and Upload Amended Rates</h5>
                    <p>The carrier updates the exported file with the necessary amendments, such as rate changes or additions. The amended file is then uploaded back into the system by selecting the appropriate template, validity period, and rate file. A popup message confirms the successful upload of the amended rates.</p>
                    <img src="img/fullofa3.png" alt="Upload Amended Rates">
                    
                    <h5>Step 4: Shipper Reviews and Counters</h5>
                    <p>Once the amended rates are uploaded, they become available to the shipper for review. Each amended rate is associated with a unique Reference ID, ensuring traceability. The shipper has the option to counter specific rates or accept them as-is. Countering involves proposing alternate rates and saving them for the carrier to review.</p>
                    <img src="img/fullofa4.png" alt="Shipper Reviews and Counters">
                    
                    <h5>Step 5: Carrier Accepts or Rejects Countered OFA</h5>
                    <p>The carrier reviews the countered OFA rates provided by the shipper, including any modifications or alternate proposals. After reviewing, the carrier decides whether to accept or reject the countered rates. If accepted, the system updates the rate status, reflecting the carrier’s decision.</p>

                    <h4>Scenario 2: Revised OFA After Counter Rejection</h4>
                    <p>This process is initiated when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The carrier rejects the shipper’s countered OFA, identifying the need for revised amendments.</li>
                        <li>The carrier must upload new rates, which are subject to a second review and acceptance by the shipper.</li>
                        <li>The scenario ends with the activation of the amended rates after mutual agreement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>Step 1: Initiate the OFA Process</h5>
                    <p>The carrier selects the contract ID for which the OFA is being initiated and identifies the records requiring amendments. The selected records are exported to facilitate offline modifications.</p>

                    <h5>Step 2: Upload Amended Rates</h5>
                    <p>The carrier uploads the amended rates file using the upload function. Upon successful upload, a popup confirms that the file has been uploaded successfully. This ensures that the new rates are compatible and ready for further review.</p>
                    <img src="img/revisedofa2.png" alt="Upload Amended Rates">
                    
                    <h5>Step 3: Update Draft Status</h5>
                    <p>The system updates the OFA records with a "DRAFT" status after the amended rates are uploaded. A unique ID is assigned to each record to track changes during the amendment process.</p>
                    <img src="img/revisedofa3.png" alt="Update Draft Status">
                    
                    <h5>Step 4: Shipper Reviews and Updates Counter</h5>
                    <p>The shipper receives the updated OFA and reviews it. They update the counter OFA if needed, involving two steps: requesting amendments and revising the proposal. These updates are sent back to the carrier for further review.</p>
                    <img src="img/revisedofa4.png" alt="Shipper Reviews and Updates Counter">
                    
                    <h5>Step 5: Carrier Rejects Countered OFA</h5>
                    <p>The carrier reviews the countered OFA provided by the shipper and chooses to reject the proposed rates. A rejection popup is displayed, and the status of the OFA is updated to reflect the rejection.</p>
                    <img src="img/revisedofa5.png" alt="Carrier Rejects Countered OFA">
                    
                    <h5>Step 6: Export and Submit New Rates</h5>
                    <p>The carrier exports the rejected OFA records and prepares new rates in response to the shipper’s counter. The updated rates file is uploaded, and the OFA is submitted for approval by the shipper.</p>
                    <div style="display: flex; gap: 10px;">
                        <img src="img/revisedofa6.png" alt="Export Rejected OFA" style="width: 49%;">

                    <h5>Step 7: Shipper Final Review and Activation</h5>
                    <p>The shipper performs a final review of the revised OFA and accepts it. During this step, the system transitions the status of the revised OFA records from brown (Offer for Amendment) to green (Accepted) to indicate successful acceptance. A popup message confirms this action, ensuring the shipper acknowledges the updated rates. The shipper then activates the rates using the "FULL AMENDMENT" option on the Rate Maintenance dashboard.</p>

                    <h4>Scenario 4: Revised OFA and Partial Counter Rejection</h4>
                    <h5>Overview</h5>
                    <p>This process is initiated when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The carrier uploads an OFA, generating a unique reference number.</li>
                        <li>The shipper receives the OFA, accepts part of it, and counters the remaining lanes.</li>
                        <li>The shipper creates amendments for accepted lanes, leading to one or more amendments.</li>
                        <li>The carrier rejects the counter partial OFA and uploads revised rates for shipper review.</li>
                        <li>The shipper accepts the revised OFA, finalizing the process.</li>
                    </ul>
                
                    <h5>Step 1: Initiate the OFA Process</h5>
                    <p>The carrier starts by selecting the relevant contract ID for the OFA. Records are identified for amendments and exported for offline modification. The system generates a unique reference number for the OFA.</p>
                    <img src="img/revisedpartialofa1.png" alt="Initiate the OFA Process">
                
                    <h5>Step 2: Upload Amended Rates</h5>
                    <p>The carrier uploads the OFA, which includes new rates, and a unique reference number is generated. A popup confirms the successful upload of the amended rates.</p>

                    <h5>Step 3: Draft Status Update</h5>
                    <p>The OFA records are updated with a "DRAFT" status. Each line receives a unique OFA reference and record ID for tracking throughout the amendment process.</p>

                    <h5>Step 4: Shipper Receives and Processes the OFA</h5>
                    <p>The shipper reviews the OFA, accepts certain lanes, and counters the remaining ones. For accepted lanes, the system updates them with an "Accepted" status. For countered lanes, the original OFA reference is retained for further carrier review. A green popup message will appear once selected lanes are approved.</p>

                    <h5>Step 5: Shipper Creates Partial Amendment</h5>
                    <p>The shipper creates a partial amendment for accepted lanes. This results in a unique amendment reference ID for the accepted lanes while retaining the original OFA reference for countered lanes. The partial amendment gets an active status for the accepted lanes.</p>
                    <img src="img/revisedpartialofa5.png" alt="Shipper Creates Partial Amendment">
                
                    <h5>Step 6: Carrier Rejects Counter Partial OFA</h5>
                    <p>The carrier reviews the counter partial OFA and rejects the shipper’s counter proposal. The system reflects this action with a rejection status and a confirmation popup message.</p>
                    <img src="img/revisedpartialofa6.png" alt="Carrier Rejects Counter Partial OFA">
                
                    <h5>Step 7: Shipper Accepts and Finalizes Revised OFA</h5>
                    <p>The shipper reviews the revised OFA. Once accepted, the counter proposal transitions into the "Accepted" status. The system confirms the acceptance with a popup message, reflecting the successful acknowledgment of the revised rates.</p>

            <h2>Unit Change Report</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Unit Change Report</strong> in RateCube is designed to help users quickly identify if any unit or currency has changed in the rate card.
                This report is crucial for detecting modifications in **unit of measurement (UOM) or currency values, ensuring that any unintended changes are caught before they impact financial calculations.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Purpose of the Unit Change Report</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>🔹 Tracks unit-based modifications** such as changes from <strong>grams (gm) to kilograms (kg)</strong> or **currency updates.</li>
                <li>🔹 Ensures that carriers do not make unintentional unit shifts, which could lead to significant cost discrepancies.</li>
                <li>🔹 Provides a clear side-by-side comparison** of previous and modified values, helping users audit rate changes effectively.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>How to Use the Unit Change Report</h3>
        
            <h4>1. Access the Unit Change Report</h4>
            <p>
                Navigate to the <strong>Unit Change Report</strong> from the <strong>OFA and RFA Processes</strong> menu.
                This will open the report screen displaying relevant contracts and rate amendments.
            </p>
            <img src="img/unitchange1.png" alt="Accessing Unit Change Report">
        
            <h4>2. Reviewing Unit and Currency Modifications</h4>
            <p>
                The report highlights any changes in unit or currency fields. Users can see the before-and-after values, making it easier to detect shifts.
                For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a carrier updates a rate from grams (gm) to kilograms (kg) but forgets to adjust the value, it could result in a major difference in cost.</li>
                <li>Similarly, a currency change from USD to EUR without correct conversion can cause incorrect invoicing.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/unitchange2.png" alt="Unit and Currency Modifications">
        
            <h4>3. Applying Filters</h4>
            <p>
                Users can **filter the report** based on:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Template Selection:</strong> Choose a specific rate template.</li>
                <li><strong>Date Range:</strong> Select the period for which changes need to be reviewed.</li>
                <li><strong>Unit Type or Currency:</strong> Narrow down changes to specific unit modifications.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/unitchange3.png" alt="Filtering Unit Change Report">
        
            <h4>4. Identifying Critical Discrepancies</h4>
            <p>
                Any modifications in unit fields or currency values are <strong>highlighted in red</strong>.
                This allows users to **quickly identify** discrepancies before finalizing contract amendments.
